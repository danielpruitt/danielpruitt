            <p> My name is Daniel Pruitt and I am an aspiring web developer. I've always loved the idea of working with my hands and how technology works and I feel that web development I am able to use my creativity, work with my hands in some way, and embrace technological advances all at one time. I am a current student at the Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp and I have been teaching myself web development since 2016. Originally I went to Berry College and graduated with a bachelor's degree in Foreign Studies and Language in 2013. Since then I found my wife, Rachel, who graciously accepts me and my pursuit for a new career in web development.       Usually in my freetime, if I'm not cooking, I can be found diving into a new book, watching a movie, or trying to find anything that tells a great story. I would consider anything that can tell a great story and engage the me to be my hobby, whether that's a new TV show, movie, videogame, or a book. Outside of stories I also enjoy cooking meals for my wife and I since I love food and I can be creative with meals. One day I hope to have a house with a yard so I can grill out for the family while my Saint Bernard can roam more than my one bedroom apartment. My goal is to pursue a career in web development to provide for my family but also create websites to help the everyday user embrace technology more effectively. </p>
