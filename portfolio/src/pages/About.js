        <p className="nunito" >A full stack web developer and perpetual learner. I recieved a Bachelor Degree of Arts in Foreign Language and I have considered myself adept at learning languages, whether it is spoken or computer language. I have been teaching myself code prior to formal classroom learning of full stack development. Teamwork and collaboration have been a consistent and necessary action to execute the goal of any team I have been on. The world of coding and web development has opened my mind to explore the extensive use of this technology to bring the ultimate experience to the user.</p>
